  "prompt": "The Dungeon Master's Dilemma is a reverse roguelike game where you act as a dungeon designer for an AI adventurer. Your goal is not to kill the adventurer, but to create a compelling, challenging, and rewarding experience that keeps them engaged.\n\nEach turn, you will be presented with a selection of potential loot. You must choose up to three items to offer the adventurer. The AI adventurer, with its own hidden personality and goals, will then choose one of your offerings before proceeding to the next floor of the dungeon.\n\n- If the dungeon is too easy, the adventurer will grow bored.\n- If it's too difficult or the rewards don't match their playstyle, they will become frustrated.\n\nYour score is based on how many floors the adventurer clears before they either fall in battle or lose interest and quit. Can you design the perfect dungeon run?"
